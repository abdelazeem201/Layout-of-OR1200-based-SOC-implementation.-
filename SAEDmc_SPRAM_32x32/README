Milkyway CEL and FRAM Views for Memory Compiler SRAM

Originally, the compiled memory was intended to be a two-port SRAM. However, when importing the .lef generated by Memory Compiler into Milkyway, Milkyway encountered a stack overflow error and was unable to complete the import. This did not happen when the memory was switched to being a single-port memory. It does not affect the design, as the necessary CEL and FRAM views already exist.
