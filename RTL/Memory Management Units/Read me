The Memory Management Units (MMUs) translate the logical address space of OR1200 into physical address space as per the shown diagram below. The 36 bit logical address space is divided into couple of fields, like, bits 35-30 is the context id, bits 31-24 are the page index level 1, bits 23-13 are the page index level 2, bits 12-0 are the page offset. The context id, page index level fields are known as Virtual Page Number (VPN). The operation of address translation is shown below.
